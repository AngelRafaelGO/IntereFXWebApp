# InterFXTestWebApp

This project was made during the Ultrahackathon 2022 IntereFX.

The event had a fixed time of 72h. The main goal was to create a 60 seconds short animated film using Unreal Engine 5.

What makes IntereFX projects interesting is that they are focused on implementing interactivity thoughout mixed media productions. In this case, it was decided that the viewer 
should be able to choose among two different points of view, since the film had only two main characters : a norse inspired female warrior and a scary beast.
